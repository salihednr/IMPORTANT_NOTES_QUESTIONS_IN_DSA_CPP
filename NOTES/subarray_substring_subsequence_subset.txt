Subarray Vs Substring Vs Subsequence Vs Subset

1. Sub Array
    Sub Array Is Contigous Part Of An Array 
    Relative Order Is Important
    It Must Be Contigous
    Number Of Possible Sub Arrays Are (n(n+1))/2
    {1,2,3,4}
    {1},{1},{3},{4} : 4
    {1,2},{2,3},{3,4} : 3
    {1,2,3},{2,3,4} : 2
    {1,2,3,4} : 1
    This How It Comes The Sum Of Natural Number
    Eg {1,2,3,4,5}
    Sub Array
    {1},{2},{1,2}
    Not Sub Array
    {7} : 7 is not in the main Array
    {1,3}: Maintains Relative Order But Not Contiguous
2. Sub String
    Sub String Is Same As Sub Array But In The Case Of String Sub Array Is Called Sub String
3. Subsequence
    Subsequence Is Not Contigous But Main Relative Order
    Relative Order Is Important
    It Need Not Be Contigous
    All Sub Arrays Are Subsequence (Converse Is Not True) But Not All Subsequence Are Sub Array
    Null Set Is Subsequence
    Number Of Subsequence Is 2^n (Same As Subset)
    Take, Not Take Approach Is Used
    --- 2*2*2 = 8 Is The Possible Sub Array
    Eg {1,2,3,4,5}
    Subsequence
    {1},{2},{1,2},{1,5},{1,2,5}
    Not Subsequence
    {2,1}: It Is Subset But Not Subsequence. It Is Not Maintaining Relative Order
    {1,4,2}: It Is Subset But Not Subsequence. It Is Not Maintaining Relative Order
4. Subset
    Same That Math Concept
    All Subsequences Are Subset But Converse Is Not True
    All Subarrays Are Subset But Converse Is Not True
